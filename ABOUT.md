# About Naboraj Sarkar

**Naboraj Sarkar** (also known as **Nishant**, online identity **NS GAMMING/NISHANT**) is an Indian student,
digital creator, and emerging technologist from **Siliguri, West Bengal, India 🇮🇳**.

This document exists to provide a **deep, transparent, and long-form understanding**
of Naboraj Sarkar beyond short bios, social media summaries, or surface-level descriptions.
It is written for both **humans and search engines** to clearly understand who I am,

## Who I Am

I am a **learner by curiosity and a builder by mindset**.

My journey into technology did not begin with privilege, expensive devices, or perfect conditions.
It began with **interest, limitations, and the habit of experimenting**.
I don’t wait for ideal setups or external validation — I start with what I have and improve daily.

Over time, this mindset shaped me into someone who prefers:
- Understanding systems over memorizing tools  
- Building real things over collecting certificates  
- Long-term growth over short-term attention  

> *“Progress doesn’t come from having more resources — it comes from using what you have consistently.”*

## Early Curiosity & Growth

My interest in technology started early, through **gaming and mobile devices**.
What began as curiosity around games slowly turned into questions about
**how applications work, how systems respond, and how automation happens**.

Before owning my own device, I learned by:
- Observing app behavior
- Experimenting with settings
- Learning through trial and error

When I finally bought my **first personal mobile phone using my own money**,
it marked a shift toward **independence and responsibility**.
From that point, learning became intentional, daily, and structured.

## How I Think (Philosophy & Values)

I strongly believe:

- **Learning publicly creates accountability and authenticity**  

I am not chasing titles, trends, or shortcuts.
I am focused on **understanding deeply and building steadily**.

> *“I don’t chase outcomes. I build habits that create outcomes.”*

## Learning in Public (Why This Exists)

I document my journey openly because:

- Others can learn from **real experiences**, not polished stories  
- My growth remains **transparent and verifiable**  
- Search engines can clearly establish **authentic identity signals**  
- Progress becomes easier to track and reflect on  

This repository — and files like this one — act as a **living record**
of learning, mistakes, experiments, and improvement.

> *“When learning is visible, growth becomes inevitable.”*
