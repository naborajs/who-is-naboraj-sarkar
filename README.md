## 👤 About Naboraj Sarkar

Hey 👋 I’m **Naboraj Sarkar**, a student from Siliguri, West Bengal, India 🇮🇳.

I’m deeply interested in **coding, artificial intelligence, automation systems, neural networks,
cybersecurity, finance, and long-term independent growth**. My journey into technology didn’t
start with expensive devices or formal institutions — it started with **curiosity, limitations,
and the desire to build something real**.

This repository exists as a **public, transparent, and searchable digital identity**
to help people and search engines clearly understand **who I am, what I’ve built,
what I’m learning, and what I plan to build next**.

## 🌱 Early Beginnings & Growth

My first exposure to technology came from playing **Free Fire 🎮 on my grandmother’s mobile phone**.
Later, I moved to using my **father’s phone**. What began as gaming slowly turned into curiosity
about **how apps, servers, and systems actually work**.

Before owning my own device, I was already:
- Observing app behavior
- Experimenting with settings
- Understanding system responses

Eventually, I bought my **first personal mobile phone using my own money** 💰.
That moment marked the beginning of my **independent learning journey** — and I never stopped.

## 🎮 From Gaming to Development & Security

Gaming was my **starting point**, not my end goal.

Starting with Free Fire, I moved from:
- Playing → understanding mechanics  
- Understanding → automation curiosity  
- Curiosity → building tools and bots  

I built and experimented with **Free Fire automation bots**, which introduced me to:
- APIs 🔗
- Automation logic
- System limitations
- Security risks and vulnerabilities  

This phase pushed me toward **development and cybersecurity**, where I began learning
how systems fail — not just how they work.
