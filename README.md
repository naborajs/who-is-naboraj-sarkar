## 👤 About Naboraj Sarkar

Hey 👋 I’m **Naboraj Sarkar**, a student from Siliguri, West Bengal, India 🇮🇳.  
I’m passionate about **coding, artificial intelligence, neural networks, automation systems,
cybersecurity, finance, content creation, and long-term independent growth**.

My journey with technology didn’t begin with expensive devices or formal coaching.
It began with **curiosity, limitations, and the mindset to build something from nothing**.

This repository exists as a **public, transparent, and searchable digital identity**
to help **Google and people clearly understand** who I am, what I’ve built,
what I’m learning, and where I’m heading.

---

## 🌱 Early Beginnings (Where It All Started)

My first interaction with technology started by playing **Free Fire 🎮 on my grandmother’s mobile phone**.
Later, I used my **father’s phone**, where my interest went far beyond gaming.

I wasn’t just playing — I was observing:
- How games react to inputs  
- How apps behave differently on networks  
- How systems respond automatically  

Before owning my own phone, I already knew I wanted to **build things**, not just consume them.

Eventually, I bought my **first personal mobile phone using my own money** 💰.
That moment marked the start of my **independent journey** — and I never stopped after that.

---

## 🎮 Gaming → Creation → Development

Gaming was my **entry point**, not my destination.

Starting with **Free Fire**, I moved from:
- Playing → understanding mechanics  
- Understanding → automation curiosity  
- Curiosity → building systems  

I built and experimented with **Free Fire automation bots 🔥**, which taught me:
- API communication 🔗
- Automation logic
- Real-world constraints
- System failures, limits, and security risks  

This phase pushed me towards **development and cybersecurity**.

- Growing steadily with consistency  

Skills gained:
- Video editing ✂️

### Telegram Communities
- Built a Telegram channel with **~40,000 members**
- Channel was later **banned due to fake reports**
- Restarted again from scratch
- Currently managing **~20,000+ members**

This taught me:
- Community management
- Platform dependency risks
- Importance of backups & adaptability
