# Journey — milestones, lessons, and growth

This is a concise, SEO-friendly timeline of how I moved from curious gamer to builder focused on automation and AI.

---

## 1. Beginnings — curiosity and constraints

- First exposure: playing Free Fire on family devices. Curiosity about how apps work led to early experimentation.
- Early habits: observing app behaviour, trial-and-error configuration changes, and learning without formal resources.

> “I didn’t wait for ideal setups; I used what I had and learned by building.”

---

## 2. First independence — buying my own device

- Bought my first phone with personal savings — a turning point that made daily, intentional learning possible.
- Result: rapid iteration on small automation experiments and simple scripting projects.

---

## 3. Content & community — amplification and resilience

- Built a YouTube channel that grew to ~50K subscribers; the channel was later compromised and I rebuilt from zero.
- Built Telegram communities (40K+ at peak); after a ban due to fake reports I restarted and now manage ~20K active members.

Lessons learned: platform risk, backup strategies, and community-first moderation.

---

## 4. Transition to development & security

- Built automation bots, APIs, and early neural-network experiments.
- Focus shifted to reliability: logging, monitoring, and secure integrations (for example — GitHub-backed Life Logger workflow).

---

## 5. Present — building with impact

- Active projects: Life Logger (Telegram → GitHub integration), AI Pro Sales Assistant, CODE (AI-powered IDE), and NSCodex.
- Deployment & operations: multiple services run on Vercel/Netlify; automations run on n8n and small custom runners.

Metrics & signs of traction:
- YouTube: ~8K current subscribers
- Telegram: ~20K community members (active)

---

## 6. Forward-looking goals

- Build NSCodex into a project-first education hub.
- Expand AI agent deployments with stronger monitoring and ethical safeguards.
- Publish reproducible project blueprints and architecture docs to help other independent builders.

This journey is ongoing — I publish experiments and lessons publicly to help others learn.
